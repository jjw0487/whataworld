<h3> During my growth </h3>
I still remember the day that my father passed away.
<br>I was only thirteen and both of my older sisters were young likewise.
<br>My mum had to raise three kids herself without helping
<br>and the circumstances pushed her hard to work hard.
<br>
<br>I was a littl kid not knowing what to do
